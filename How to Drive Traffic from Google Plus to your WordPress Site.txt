Good day steemians, I'm @jacobite; founder of @netwonks (my digital focus brand) and this is my first post on @utopian-io which I have found to be an awesome platform to share exceptional ideas as well as creating opportunity for yourself. 

Today I will like to expose a hidden or not seen means of driving traffic from Google plus, but before we move on let us understand this platform.

Google+ is a social media platform own by Google, just like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and so on Google+ enables you to share links, text, images videos, PDF, etc.. Also Google plus receives a lot of traffic daily, millions of users make use of Google+ on a daily basis, in which we will be talking on how to direct some of the traffic to our own sites/blogs.

Easy, isn’t it? , am glad we can now move to the next step on how to drive traffic from Google+. On getting to Google plus, you will find different sections of which are Communities, Circle, People & Pages, and Collections. Since we are in a step by step mode I would explain each and every section as relating them to means of driving traffic to your blog.

Let start, after setting up your profile in the most attractive way, start adding people, join communities, and collections, you might want to ask who to follow, or which community to join. When you get to Google+ home page you see a search box, type in your niche related word, and follow the people in there also join communities. Now our major means of traffic would be through Circle and Communities.
# Lets talk about Circles
Circle allows users to put different people in specific list that is known and seen by only the user (the account owner) it is a very nice and useful section which is the major part of us getting traffic on Google+. This section on Google plus is used to share contents with the people in that list also to follow contents posted by people in that list
No user in the circle you’ve created can see who is in the circle, know the name of the circle, or how many people are there. Let us go through how to add friends to circles. From the friends we’ve been able to gather from communities, people & pages, and collections we can now move forward by adding them to circles. 
# How to create a circle that drives traffic

* Go to Google+ homepage
* In the Navigation menu, you will see search
* Search for the community relating to your niche and join
* Now look out for the members in there.
* Visit their profiles.
* Click Following.
* Click NEW CIRCLE.
* Name your circle, then click CREATE.

From there you can keep on adding people you want to be in that particular group also you can get good members by reading those that comment then follow then. To add users mentioned in a post or comment, all you have to do is hover their avatar. You’ll see their name, visit their profile then add them.
# How to share to your post to circle
- After making your post ready, then you use your site share button a pop us show requiring who you want to share the post with usually it shows Public first then you add your circle name then click share.
- Using the main site, after pasting your link on the post area then in the tag side you will add your circle name. 
Note: 
- The post will not only reflect on their timeline, but would go directly to their mail box which is their Gmail inbox, this is one of the noted means of driving traffic via Google+ circle.
- There is a limit of how many people that your post can get to their email, if you want you post to get to their email add at list 30 people in a circle and create another circle. E.g Local blogger1, Local blogger2, Local blogger3, Local blogger4 etc.

# How to add or remove someone from a circle
When you follow someone, they are put in your "Following" circle automatically. To add someone to your "Following" circle, follow that person.
* To add someone to a different circle:
* Go to Google+ homepage.
* Open the profile of the person you want to move to another circle.
* Click on the Following button, or the checkmark next to their name.
* Use the menu to add them to another circle.
* Click DONE.

# To remove someone from a circle:
* Go to Google+ homepage.
* Open the profile of the person you want to remove.
* Click the name of the circle that they're in.
* In the menu that appears, uncheck a circle to remove them from that circle.
* Click DONE.

# Now let’s move on to Communities, Collections, and People & Pages.
Google’s side view of group or forum is called Community. Communities are sections where a group of members are being put together to share their questions, contents, links, comments, images, videos or anything related to the purpose of creating it. For example, if you are a member of a blogging community, you will see that all posts in there are related blogging, and if anyone make on anything not relating to blogger he/she can be kicked out or the post will be removed by the moderator.

# Now talking on how to get the best out of the communities 
It is not advisable you create your own community, because they are lot of communities on ground already, just search for your niche related community with a lot of members and join then you can share your posts on it and also get friends from it.
This will lead us to collection, you can also create your own collection but it’s advisable you follow collection already available and search for your niche related collections too. Also add people in the People and Page section.
